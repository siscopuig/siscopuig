# PRINCIPLES

devops:

   The more you know about devops, the better your code will be:
   Knowing the environment where your code run gives an advantage 
   that looks far past my own machine, also it gives me a new set 
   of skills that I could apply in my daily work as a developer.

Security:

   Secure code is good code.
   As a software developer, it is my responsibility to make sure that any software 
   produced is not used to cause harm; you must ensure that your software is secure.


Code:

   Good code is code that has good design.
   The cleaner the code, the better you'll be seen as a professional and the 
   easier it will be to make adjustments, correct bugs and implement new features 
   in the future.


Personal

   Be proactive, not reactive.
   Having a forward-thinking attitude, I'm always receptive to new ideas and 
   possibilities in order to construct a solid vision that helps to my achieve goals.


Design

   Clean Â­in thinking, in style.
   Simple, minimal and effective. This is my mantra and method. Creativity is essential, but 
   it never can interfere with usability.
