# PRINCIPLES

devops:
   The more you know about devops, the better your code will be.
      -  Knowing the environment where you your code run.
      -  that looks far past my own machine
      -  it gave me a new set of skills I could apply in my daily work as a developer.
      -  Process Management, Threads and Concurrency, Sockets, I/O Management, 
         Virtualization, Memory storage and File systems.

Security:

   Secure code is good code.

   As a software developer, it is your responsibility to make sure that your software, 
   or the pieces of it that you write, are not used to cause harm to your or your 
   clientâ€™s organization; you must ensure that your software is secure.

Code:

   Good code is code that has good design.

   The cleaner your code, the better you'll be seen as a professional and the 
   easier it will be for you to make adjustments, correct bugs and implement 
   new features in the future.

Personal

   Be proactive, not reactive.
   Having a forward-thinking attitude, I'm always receptive to new ideas and possibilities 
   in order to construct a solid vision that helps to achieve goals.
