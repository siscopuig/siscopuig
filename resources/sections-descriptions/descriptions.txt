Agile

Is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product 
development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides 
a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off 
the rails. Today, agile is hardly a competitive advantage. No one has the luxury
to develop a product for years or even months in a black box. 
This means itâ€™s more important than ever to get it right.

Kanban

Is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing 
efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take 
a project(or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban 
board and continuously imporving their flow of work.

Scrum 

Teams commit to ship working software through set intervals called sprints. 
Their goal is to create learnng loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. 
Scrum teams adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies 
to keep things moving forward.

JIRA

is a web-based project management platform that uses the Kanban and Scrum paradigms 
for managing projects.

BaaS (Backend as a Service)

Is a cloud computing service model that serves as the middleware

applications to cloud services via application programming interfaces (API) 
and software developers' kits (SDK).
